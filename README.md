# Welcome to Local Ghost 3000

Local Ghost is an interactive database that allows you to find hauntings in your area (currently only in Montana). 

Be safe, be smart and happy haunting.

## Setting up Local Ghost 3000

You will need node.js to run this application. If you are unfamiliar with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) follow their directions in getting set up on your machine. 

Once you're done there or if you already have node.js on your machine 

1. **Clone the repository**
    * In the project folder ```npm install``` to download all neccesary dependencies.
2. **Serve the app to localhost**
    * Open a terminal window and cd into project folder.
    * On the master branch run ```serve -s build``` this will launch the app at localhost:5000
3. **Launch the server**
    * Open a second terminal window/tab
    * From the root of the project run ```node src/server.js``` this will launch the server on your local machine and allow requests to our database.
4. **Explore** 
    * Open a new browser window and navigate to [LocalGhost](http://localhost:5000) or enter http://localhost:5000
